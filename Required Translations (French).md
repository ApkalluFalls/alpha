# Required Translations (French)

Please refer to [Required Translations](https://github.com/ApkalluFalls/alpha/blob/master/Required%20Translations.md) before doing anything else.

The following strings require translation into French:

## Website Text

* Tradeable
* {0} can be purchased from the in-game market board.
* Why am I seeing this?
* With the version 2.1 upgrade of Apkallu Falls, XIVDB support has been completely dropped and now we\'re using XIVAPI instead.
* XIVAPI has not seen this character before, so needs to fetch its data from the Lodestone. Once done, you shouldn\'t ever see this message again for this character.

## Chocobo Barding

* Raise the chocobo companion\'s {0} skill tree to level 10.
* Be one of the lucky winners selected during official forum contests.
