# Optional Translations (Any Language)

Apkallu Falls supports French, German and Japanese by default, but there's no reason it can't branch out into languages the game client does not support. If you're interested in translating Apkallu Falls into your own language, here is a list of all strings used on the website.

Please refer to [Required Translations](https://github.com/ApkalluFalls/alpha/blob/master/Required%20Translations.md) before doing anything else.

* Add to XIVSync
* XIVSync is a service provided by XIVDB which polls the data millions of Final Fantasy XIV characters. Apkallu Falls' character add relies on  this service. Characters need to be manually added to XIVSync, but don't worry, this only needs to be done once. You can think of this like attuning to an Aetheryte in-game, but without the glamorous teleportation abilities thereafter.

* The achievements list page is currently a work-in-progress, along with the achievement census. These should be ready some time in the next 2 weeks.
* Achievement Categories
* There are {0} achievements in this category.
* As there are so many achievements, having them all dispalyed in one long list wouldn't make much sense. Because of that, this page has been split into multiple categories which represent the achievement list you are familiar with in-game.
* Click on any category below to be taken to that category's list of achievements.
* Ranked PvP
* The statistics below are based on the achievements this character has unlocked and can therefore wildly vary and jump quickly. Using Carpenter Levequests as an example, the III and IV achievements leap from 40 to 80, this means if a character has completed 79 unique leves in this category, the statistic below will only count 40 of them.

* In-game events
* Mog Station and Square Enix Store purchases
* The Feast season rewards
* Marketing campaigns and fan festivals
* Disused Legacy (1.0) content
* Lodestone contest rewards
