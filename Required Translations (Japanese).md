* Add to XIVSync
* XIVSync is a service provided by XIVDB which polls the data millions of Final Fantasy XIV characters. Apkallu Falls\' character add relies on  this service. Characters need to be manually added to XIVSync, but don\'t worry, this only needs to be done once. You can think of this like attuning to an Aetheryte in-game, but without the glamorous teleportation abilities thereafter.
