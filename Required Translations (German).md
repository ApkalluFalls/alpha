The following strings require translation into German:

* The statistics below are based on the achievements this character has unlocked and can therefore wildly vary and jump quickly. Using Carpenter Levequests as an example, the III and IV achievements leap from 40 to 80, this means if a character has completed 79 unique leves in this category, the statistic below will only count 40 of them.

* What content does Apkallu Falls hide?
* By default, Apkallu Falls hides any content which is unobtainable, time-limited or promotional. This is split into two categories, {i0} and {i1}, and includes:
* In-game events
* Mog Station and Square Enix Store purchases
* The Feast season rewards
* Marketing campaigns and fan festivals
* Disused Legacy (1.0) content
* Lodestone contest rewards
* Starting city achievements
* This content is still accessible, take the {0} for example, it just doesn't display within the content lists without first applying a filter, nor does this hidden content count towards character progress displayed in the sidebar when tracking a character.
* Is Apkallu Falls too bright?
* Not a fan of dark mode?
* Enable Dark Mode
* Switch back to Light Mode
* Dark Mode is currently an expermiental feature, and may still require work to iron out the creases.
* Achievement points

* Why am I seeing this?
* With the version 2.1 upgrade of Apkallu Falls, XIVDB support has been completely dropped and now we\'re using XIVAPI instead.
* XIVAPI has not seen this character before, so needs to fetch its data from the Lodestone. Once done, you shouldn\'t ever see this message again for this character.
