# Required Translations (German)

Please refer to [Required Translations](https://github.com/ApkalluFalls/alpha/blob/master/Required%20Translations.md) before doing anything else.

The following strings require translation into German:

## Website Text

* Achievements already public? Your character may not be synchronised with XIVSync.
* Add {0} to XIVSync
* Add Character to XIVSync
* Add to XIVSync
* XIVSync is a service provided by XIVDB which polls the data millions of Final Fantasy XIV characters. Apkallu Falls\' character add relies on  this service. Characters need to be manually added to XIVSync, but don\'t worry, this only needs to be done once. You can think of this like attuning to an Aetheryte in-game, but without the glamorous teleportation abilities thereafter.
* Search for a character on The Lodestone...
* Adding to XIVSync...
* Reset
* Select the character you wish to add from the list below.
* Success! {0}\'s data will now be synced.
