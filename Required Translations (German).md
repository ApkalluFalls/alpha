# Required Translations (German)

Please refer to [Required Translations](https://github.com/ApkalluFalls/alpha/blob/master/Required%20Translations.md) before doing anything else.

The following strings require translation into German:

## Website Text

* Progress towards Patreon goal {0}.
* Emotes
* emotes
* emote
* Default
* Note
* {0} data is not publicly accessible. Because of this, Apkallu Falls cannot determine whether any of the below {1} have already been unlocked by this character. For now, this is just a list of how to obtain them. In future, this may be expanded to turn this into a manual checklist.

## Emote Obtain Methods

* Rewarded for having a friend subscribe during the {i0}.
* Purchase {i1} directly from the {i0}.
* Purchase {i9} for {img2} {i0} {i1} from {3} {4} in {img5} {6} (x: {7}, y: {8}).
* Purchase {i2} from {0} during the {i1} event.
* Achieve {0} reputation with the {i1} Beast Tribe, then purchase {i11} for {img4} {i2} {i3} from {5} {6} in {img7} {8} (x: {9}, y: {10}).
* Unlocked by default.
* Unlocked when enlisting with Grand Company: {i0}. You can only have one of `__emotes__` at a time.
