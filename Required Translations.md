# Required Translations

Begin by reading http://alpha.apkallufalls.com/translate.

I've collected all of the strings required for translating in the below files:

* [Required Translations (French)](https://github.com/ApkalluFalls/alpha/blob/master/Required%20Translations%20(French).md)
* [Required Translations (German)](https://github.com/ApkalluFalls/alpha/blob/master/Required%20Translations%20(German).md)
* [Required Translations (Japanese)](https://github.com/ApkalluFalls/alpha/blob/master/Required%20Translations%20(Japanese).md)

Note that some of these strings may be duplicated; I've kept these duplications here for my sake more than anything, as it quickly lets me know where the strings need to be placed within the localisation code.

## How can I translate these?

Just give me a prod: @ApkalluFalls on Twitter, post in the Translations room on Discord or email translate@apkallufalls.com.

Many thanks!
