# Required Translations

Begin by reading http://alpha.apkallufalls.com/translate.

I've collected all of the strings required for translating in the below files:

* [Required Translations (French)](https://github.com/ApkalluFalls/alpha/blob/master/Required%20Translations%20(French).md)
* [Required Translations (German)](https://github.com/ApkalluFalls/alpha/blob/master/Required%20Translations%20(German).md)
* [Required Translations (Japanese)](https://github.com/ApkalluFalls/alpha/blob/master/Required%20Translations%20(Japanese).md)

Note that some of these strings may be duplicated; I've kept these duplications here for my sake more than anything, as it quickly lets me know where the strings need to be placed within the localisation code.

## How can I translate these?

Just give me a prod: @ApkalluFalls on Twitter, post in the Translations room on Discord or email translate@apkallufalls.com.

## FAQ

#### What do string parts like `{0}` and `__achievement__` mean?

These represent places where other text is injected into the string.

For example, the string "Speak to `{0}` in `{1}`" could have "Jonathas" inserted into `{0}` and "Old Gridania" inserted into `{1}` to create "Speak to Jonathas in Old Gridania".

The `__text__` parts are simply more complex versions of the curly braces representations.
